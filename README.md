#Side Scrolling Game 

This was my first attempt to make a game. 
I open-sourced this game I had designed for anyone else want to learn some techniques I learned in mobile app development class. 

This game is intend for children who intend to identify numbers and how to catch them to get the exact sum selected by computer. 
A player can jump small with one tap and a big jump with two taps.
No leaderboard, just for fun.
 
So Have FUN!
